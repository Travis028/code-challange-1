# Event Guest List Manager

This is a simple, interactive web application for managing a guest list for an event. It allows you to add guests, remove them, track their RSVP status.

## Features

*   **Add Guests**: Enter a guest's name and add them to the list.
*   **Remove Guests**: Each guest has a "Remove" button to delete them from the list.
*   **RSVP Toggling**: Mark guests as "Attending" or "Not Attending". The status is visually indicated.
*   **Guest Limit**: The list is capped at 10 guests to keep the event manageable. An alert will notify you if the limit is reached.
*   **Theme Switcher**: Toggle between a light and a dark theme. Your preference is saved in `localStorage`.
